# String Matching algorithms

## KMP

This is a string algorithm mainly for single pattern string problems. 

## Aho-Corasick

This is a Trie based string algorithm. It is often utilized for multi pattern problems.

## Z-algorithm

The Z algorithm is similar to KMP, but most of the time Z-algorithm is not needed if you can apply KMP. Z-algorithm is also used for single pattern string problems.
